## About Brooklyn McKee

Hello, my name is Brooklyn McKee. I am curently studying business analytics at the University of Iowa, with a minor in American Sign Langugae

Here I have displayed the experiences I have had thus far in my career. As I continously aim to improve my craft I will update this site to reflect my newfound knowledge.

If you know me, you know I like to fill my life with lots of outdoor adventures; plus, learning various new skills. An ideal morning for me would start with enjoying a warm cup of coffee, while watching the sunrise and listening to a podcast. When I have free time, you can find me exploring and running through new trails, researching and attending events around the community, or completing home improvement projects.

Now that you know a little about me, please explore! Feel free to reach out on any linked media below

### Internships
The previous summer (2022) I had the privledge to work with the Data Analyst Team at Zirous Inc. Through this opportunity I researched a Microsoft's newest data governance portal called Microsoft Purview. **Microsoft Purview** is used to provide a unified data governance sollution to help enterprises manage and monitor their on-prem servers, multicloud, and SaaS data. The tool is easy to use creating a holistic, automatically updating map of the users data landscape through discovery, sensitive data classification, and lineage tracking. 


### Projects
In my free time I have began to work on coursera educational courses to further my knowledge.


## Additional Information
I also began research toward the field of a UI/UX designer
