## About Brooklyn McKee

Hello, my name is Brooklyn McKee. I am curently studying business analytics at the University of Iowa, with a minor in American Sign Langugae

I like to fill my life with lots of outdoor activites and learning various new skills. An ideal day for me would start with enjoying a warm cup of coffee, while watching the sunrise and listening to a podcast. When I have free time, you can find me exploring and running through new trails, researching and attending events around the community, or completing home improvement projects.

This site displays the projects and experiences I am most fond of. As I continously aim to improve my craft I will update this site to reflect my newfound knowledge.

Now that you know a little about me, please explore! Feel free to reach out on any linked media below

Thank you for visiting!

### Projects
In my free time I have began to work on coursera educational courses to further my knowledge.


### Internships
The previous summer (2022) I had the privledge to work with the Data Analyst Team at Zirous Inc. Through this opportunity I researched a Microsoft's newest data governance portal called Microsoft Purview. **Microsoft Purview** is used to provide a unified data governance sollution to help enterprises manage and monitor their on-prem servers, multicloud, and SaaS data. The tool is easy to use creating a holistic, automatically updating map of the users data landscape through discovery, sensitive data classification, and lineage tracking. 

I also began research toward the field of a UI/UX designer
